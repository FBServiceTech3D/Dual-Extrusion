# Orbiter 2.0 Y Filament Sensor

## BOM
- 1 x micro switch
- 1 x 6mm magnetic steel ball
- 1 x 5mm x 2mm N45 permanent round magnet
- 2 x M2x12mm screws 
- 2 x M2 hex nuts
- 2 x M6 PTFE fittings or 2 x collets and clips
- 1 x small PTFE tube piece between sensor and extruder

## Printing
- 0.2mm first layer height
- 0.1mm base layer height
- generate supports
- autogenerate supports
- supports only on build plate
- part is already in the correct orientation
- put the magnet via print in place in its pocket

## Post processing
- clean the filament path
- the micro switch orientation matters, make sure the lever points to the small lever pocket
- make sure the sensor works, you can move it slightly to support more types of switches
