# PTFE Tube Inline Filament Sensor

A simple but highly reliable filament sensor

## Printing
- the part is already oriented correctly
- print with 0.1mm layer height
- put the magnet via print in place in its pocket

## BOM
- Micro Switch
- 6 mm magnetic steel ball
- 5 mm x 2 mm N45 permanent round magnet
- 2 x M2 screws 
- 2 x M2 nuts
- 2 x PTFE tube fittings

## IMPORTANT
- chamfer all PTFE Tubes on the filament entry side, DO NOT chamfer them on the filament exit side
- Although externally not visible, the sensor has a top and a bottom side. The side touching the build plate is the bottom side, thats the side that points to the extruder.
