# PTFE Tube Y-Junction

A simple and nearly frictionless PTFE Tube Y-Junction

## Printing

## IMPORTANT
- use the provided jigs to cut the PTFE tubes to their correct size and shape
- chamfer all PTFE Tubes on the filament entry side, DO NOT chamfer them on the filament exit side
- do not try to push the PTFE tubes completely into the part, let the fittings do the rest
- the entrance jig has two cutting surfaces, its important to cut the filament on both sides
