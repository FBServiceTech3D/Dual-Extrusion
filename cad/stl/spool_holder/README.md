# Double Spool Holder

A simple double spool holder with mounting plates for different extruders
(work in progress)

This is a modified version of the official RatRig spool holder.

## Printing
- the parts are already oriented correctly
- print with 0.2mm - 0.3mm layer height

## BOM
- 4 x M8 Hex Nut
- 4 x 608 Bearings
- a threaded 8mm rod
- hot glue because im lazy

## IMPORTANT
- mount the extruder plates to the mounting plates with hot glue (sorry for that)
